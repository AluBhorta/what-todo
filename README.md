# What-ToDo

An app that let's you handle multiple (todo) lists. (+ all the lorems)

## Prospective Features (i.e. to implement)

- convert the listTitles to -> lowercase and dashes (for space) to use as the "/:url"
- ensure unique list title names (using '(...|...)' regex)
- priority buttons (up & down) for the list items

- add/rm/edit btns -> add(+ icon / full sized btn) / remove(trash-bin icon) / edit(pencil icon) TodoLists and ListItems
- Save Progress to be implemented on add / remove / edit of Lists or Items
  - (advanced) try not updating the whole state on "save progress", instead send a query to append/remove/update a particular list/item
- list items sorted by priority or chronologically ?(ask user)
- auth/login for the app use (google/fb/...)
- to style:

  - make the brand logo btn to be obvious/clear
  - make 'add item' and 'add list' as MODALS
  - "save progress" btn
  - list items
  - header
  - margins on list items
  - project link through footer
  - smooth transitions from lists to dashboard
  - design a logo for WHAT-TODO?
